INSTRUCTIONS
DATA MODEL:

üë§ Users The Users collection stores information about the application users.

Each user has the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for the user.
name: The user's name.
email: The user's email address.
password: The user's password, securely stored.
movies: A list of movies that the user has added to their list.
genres: The movie's genre, stored as a reference to the corresponding genre document.

üé¨ Movies The Movies collection stores information about the movies that users have added to their list.

Each movie has the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for the movie.
name: The movie's name.
poster_image: The URL of the movie poster image, stored in Cloudinary.
score: The movie's score, assigned by the user when adding the movie to their list.
genre: The movie's genre, stored as a reference to the corresponding genre document.
sinopsis: A brief description of the movie. 

üè∑Ô∏è Genres The Genres collection stores the different movie genres that users can select when adding a movie to their list. 

Each genre has the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for the genre.
name: The genre's name.
These are the basic data models that we will use in this project.

# PART 1

The directory and file structure generated by Next.js. The important files to consider are:
app: This folder contains the application's routing structure using the App Router. Routes are defined here, and routing options are configured. You can find more information about the App Router in Next.js documentation.

pages: This folder contains the application's pages. Each file in this folder represents a route in the application. For example, if you have a file called "about.tsx" in this folder, the "/about" route will display the content of that file.

public: This folder is used to store static assets that will be served by Next.js, such as images, CSS files, or JavaScript files. Files in this folder can be accessed directly from the application's URL root.

src: This folder is optional and is used to store the application's source code. Here you can place your components, styles, and any other files related to the application's logic.


# PART 2


In this part, the objective is understand how to migrate components and pages from React to Next.js and familiarize yourself with Next.js routing system, including dynamic routes.

# PART 3
Use SSR to fetch data and implement logic to perform CRUD operations on the movie list.

# PART 4
Understand how to integrate Auth0 into a Next.js application and familiarize yourself with the authentication and authorization flow using Auth0.
